# A-Real-time-LSTM-Framework-for-NBA-Game-Prediction
Sports prediction has garnered significant interest in recent years due to its potential applications in betting,
fantasy sports, and strategic decision-making for teams and fans alike. In this study, we propose a real-time Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) framework 
tailored specifically for predicting National Basketball Association (NBA) game outcomes. LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) capable of 
capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data, making them well-suited for modelling the dynamics of basketball games. We evaluate the performance of 
our LSTM framework using a comprehensive dataset spanning multiple NBA seasons and demonstrate its ability to outperform baseline methods and traditional 
statistical models in terms of predictive accuracy. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to analyse the impact of different input features, model 
architectures, and hyperparameters on prediction performance. The burgeoning interest in sports prediction has spurred the development of innovative frameworks
aimed at enhancing predictive accuracy and informing strategic decision-making across various domains, including betting, fantasy sports, and team management.
In response to this demand, we propose a real-time Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) framework specifically tailored for predicting
National Basketball Association (NBA) game outcomes.LSTMs, a subtype of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), possess the inherent capability to capture intricate
long-term dependencies within sequential data, rendering them ideally suited for modelling the dynamic and evolving nature of basketball games.
Leveraging a comprehensive dataset spanning multiple NBA seasons, we meticulously evaluate the performance of our LSTM framework. Our evaluation demonstrates
its superiority over baseline methods and traditional statistical models in terms of predictive accuracy, highlighting its efficacy in discerning underlying
patterns and trends in NBA game outcomes. Furthermore, we undertake a systematic exploration of various factors influencing prediction performance,
including input feature selection, model architectures, and hyperparameter tuning. Through extensive experimentation and analysis, we elucidate the
nuanced impacts of these factors on the predictive capabilities of our LSTM framework, providing valuable insights for future refinement and optimization
efforts.Overall, our study contributes to the burgeoning field of sports analytics by presenting a robust and adaptable LSTM framework tailored specifically
for NBA game outcome prediction. By harnessing the power of deep learning and sequential data modelling, our framework offers a promising avenue for
enhancing decision-making processes and gaining deeper insights into the complex dynamics of basketball games.
